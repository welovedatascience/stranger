    <p>Function that produces visualizations to understand the anomaly score locally around a specific data point.
We believe this should help people to trust scores a made by models even if they don’t fully understand them.
Today, 5 visualisazions are implemented;
(1) A hierarchical clustering, named "cluster", showing among the top n-anomaly which records belongs to the same cluster
a specific record. Finding the commun pattern amoung the cluster may lead to the orign of of the specifi record score.
(2) A dots plot, named "neighbours", showing the relationship between the anomly score and each feature for the
k nearest neighbours of a specific record.
(3) A bar chart, named "feature_importance", showing how sensitive is the anomaly score of a specific record to each of feature.
This may help to identify the features behind the score.
(4) A dots plot, names "score_decline", showing the decrease in anomaly score among the k nearest neighbours of a specific record.
The shape indicates how extrem and how frequent is the anomaly score of a speicif record amoung its neighbours.
(5) A Regression tree, named "regression_tree", showing the roots to high score around a specific record.</p>
